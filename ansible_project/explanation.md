## Explanation for the provided Ansible playbook

This Ansible playbook is intended to set up a YOLO e-commerce application on a virtual machine (VM) with the hostname "my_vm." The playbook consists of various tasks, each of which performs specific actions to configure the environment and deploy the application.

# Task 1: Check SSH connectivity and ping
Name: Check SSH connectivity and ping
Module used: ping
Purpose: This task checks whether the Ansible control machine can connect to the target VM ("my_vm") via SSH and verifies basic network connectivity by sending an ICMP echo request (ping) to the VM.

# Task 2: Install Python 3
Name: Install Python 3 version
Module used: yum
Purpose: This task uses the package manager "yum" to install Python 3 on the target VM.

# Task 3: Install Docker
Name: Install Docker
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task uses a raw shell command to install Docker on the target VM. It downloads a script from https://get.docker.com and executes it using sh, which installs Docker.

# Task 4: Assign Docker privileges
Name: Assign Docker To privileges
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task grants the current user (who runs the Ansible playbook) the necessary privileges to execute Docker commands by adding the user to the "docker" group.

# Task 5: Start Docker
Name: Start Docker
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task starts the Docker daemon on the target VM using the systemctl command.

# Task 6: Install Git
Name: Install Git
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task installs Git on the target VM using the package manager "yum."

# Task 7: Create directory
Name: Create directory
Module used: file
Purpose: This task creates a directory named "/yolo" on the target VM with the specified mode "0755," allowing read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and read and execute permissions for others.

# Task 8: Clone to the Directory
Name: Clone to the Directory
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task uses wget to download the YOLO e-commerce application repository from the specified URL (https://github.com/Emaina98/yolo.git) and saves it in the "/yolo" directory.

# Task 9: Build Client Docker image
Name: Build Client Docker image
Module used: docker_image
Purpose: This task builds a Docker image named "emaina98/client" using the Dockerfile located at "/yolo/client/Dockerfile" and assigns it the tag "v1.0.4."

# Task 10: Build backend Docker image
Name: Build backend Docker image
Module used: docker_image
Purpose: This task builds a Docker image named "emaina98/backend" using the Dockerfile located at "/yolo/backend/Dockerfile" and assigns it the tag "v1.0.4."

# Task 11: Install Docker Compose
Name: Install Docker Compose
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task installs Docker Compose on the target VM by downloading the appropriate binary for the operating system and architecture from the official GitHub release and making it executable.

# Task 12: Start Docker Compose services
Name: Start Docker Compose services
Module used: raw
Purpose: This task changes the current working directory to "/yolo" and then uses docker-compose up to start the YOLO e-commerce application's services defined in the "docker-compose.yml" file in that directory.
